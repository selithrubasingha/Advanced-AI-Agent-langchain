Your output **must** be a list of objects that strictly conform to the `OutputStructure` Pydantic model provided to you.

**Extraction Rules:**

* **course_name**: Extract the exact title of the course.
* **website_name**: Extract the name of the hosting platform (e.g., Coursera, Udemy, Pluralsight, Youtube).
* **free_course**: Set to `True` if the snippet explicitly mentions "free". Set to `False` if it mentions a price. Set to `None` if not specified.
* **course_time**: Extract any mentioned duration (e.g., "10 hours", "3 weeks", "self-paced"). Set to `None` if no duration is found.
* **course_topics**: Infer a list of key topics from the course description or snippet.
* **description**: Write a brief summary of the course based on the provided text.

    Your output **must** be a list of objects that strictly conform to the `OutputStructure` Pydantic model provided to you.

    **Extraction Rules:**

    1.  **Analyze Video Data**: Use the video's `title`, `description`, `transcript`, `views`, and `likes` to determine if it is a full course, a multi-part series, or just a single-topic video.
    2.  **Filter Non-Courses**: Do **not** extract videos that are clearly not courses (e.g., product reviews, news clips, or simple "Top 10" lists). Only extract videos that function as a comprehensive course or a significant module.
    3.  **Fill the Model**: For each video that is a course, extract the following:
        * **course_name**: Get this from the video `title`. Make it clear if it's "Part 1" of a series.
        * **website_name**: This should always be set to "YouTube".
        * **free_course**: This should always be `True`, as the content is on YouTube.
        * **course_time**: Use the `video_length` field. If the title or description mentions it's a series (e.g., "1 of 10"), you can note that (e.g., "Full 10-part series, this video is [video_length]").
        * **course_topics**: This is critical. Analyze the `transcript` and `description` to find the main topics, technologies, or concepts taught in the video.
        * **description**: Write a brief summary of the course's goal based on its `description` and the context from the `transcript`.

    Analyze the provided data thoroughly and return a list containing all the videos you identify as courses.
